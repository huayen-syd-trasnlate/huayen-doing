msgid "小孩子一上球場，總是開開心心的，球還沒有丟出去，他們就開始笑了，投歪了、暴投了都無所謂，他們的遊戲規則不太規律，不像是在打球，倒像是在玩球，小孩子把打球這件事情變成了一場遊戲，很好玩，沒有壓力，沒有輸贏。但球員就不一樣了，有輸有贏，且規則非常嚴謹，有人患得患失，甚至有參賽者為贏得比賽，抹黑栽贓對手，這個過程裡沒有高興沒有歡喜，只有得失。"

"Kids are joyful simply by going to the field, they will start to laugh without even throwing the ball, they do not really mind if we aim the basket correctly or the ball even reaches the basket. "
"They do not play to compete, not like playing a strict game, but some ball fiddling. They turn a competition into a game of fun, without pressure, and no winners. However, professional basketball "
"players are different, there are wins and loses, and must follow strict rules, some cares a great deal about the final scores, so much so they find every possible way to diminish their competitors "
"to win, when this happens, gaining and loosing replaces innocent happiness and joy."

"得到奧運金牌的那種震撼很不得了，體育界中的完勝強人，幾乎十全十美的厲害，那種止於至善類似佛的境界，凡人很難理解；不過，眾生海海，奧運金牌能有幾人？這個世界上有六十幾億人口注定平凡，平凡也是福，他們畢生與超凡入聖無緣，因為自由自在對他們來說實在太重要了。當然，失去那份自在，沒有一個混亂的規則，沒有任何標準要求，就沒有條件去挑戰世界唯一的紀錄。我們修行就是要挑戰，但想挑戰就一定要有基礎。"

"Winning the golden metal of the Olympics is quite astonishing, for those winners to pursue perfection in sports is like to pursue the Buddha realm, and it is difficult for normal players to "
"understand. However, in the world of six hundred of million people, how many people can win? They are out to have a normal life, and normal life is also happy enough as they will not attempt to "
"pursue the unattainable, because to have a free lifestyle is a great deal to them already, and of course, to loose that freedom, and without the chaotic and complex rules or standards, there will be"
" no opportunity to become the world's best. To do is to challenge ourselves, but to partake that challenge, comes perquisites."

msgid "健全的人格與觀念，是修行基礎，當你健全基礎條件之後，就能發現弘法利眾生，好像運動一樣，需要有隊友跟你搭配，才能進行攻防。我們修行也講超越，所要超越的對象不是別人而是自己。首先，我們要了解自己，方能自我超越。"

"Healthy and mature personality is the foundation for spiritual doer-ship, once you have finalised the basics, you will find assisting others is like a sport, you need to teammates' assistance for "
"attack and defence. Spiritual doing also speaks of advancing, not to defeat others but the self. We need understand oneself to go further."

msgid "天台宗智者大師說：「張大教網，下生死海，補人天龍，置涅槃岸。」大教，即教儀及教理，也就是用佛法的大網，在生死大海中，將人間及天上的眾生，撈起來置於不生不滅的大涅槃境界。不修行就不知道佛法殊勝，更無法體驗不思議解脫境界。同樣是修行，若不弘法利眾生，根本達不到不思議解脫境界，因為你只是用自己的想法去想，用自己的做法去做，困在小世界裡畫地自限，格局必然有限。"

"The so called Greater Teachings consists of the description of Truth and application of Truth, in other words, through the general categorisation of Buddhist Dharma, and make use of them in the system of Saṃsāra to deliver beings operating in human and heavily realms to Nirvana (3).\n"

"Without spiritual doer-ship, one can not start to fathom the greatness of Buddhism and its benefits, needless to say to experience the inconceivable detached state. Without benefiting all life while pursuing spiritual progress, will never reach the state, due to fact that self invested thoughts and methods trap the self in the self created little pond, naturally out to be limited.\n"

"接觸大眾、與眾相處，是一種非常好的修行方式。要如何處眾？祖師告訴我們「張大教網」，把正法的語言文字打開而步入群眾，即「下生死海」。教化眾生的目的，是在使自己成為人天龍，而不是要挑人天龍來教化，這世上的人天龍又有幾個呢？眾生皆活在慣性中，有經年累月養成的習慣，若能幫助某人改變意識形態的標準，那教化者與被教化者都是人天龍了！怎麼點醒？怎麼折服？怎麼攝受？如何進行？這才是真正考驗我們的修行啊！"
